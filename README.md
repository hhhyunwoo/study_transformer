# Transformer Study Guide

A 5-day intensive study program to deeply understand Transformer architecture and implement it from scratch.

## Overview

This repository contains a structured learning path to master the Transformer architecture, from theoretical foundations to practical implementation. The program is designed to take you from zero to implementing your own GPT-like model in just 5 days.

## Study Plan

### Day 1: Understanding Attention Mechanism (4-6 hours)

**Morning: Theory**

- 📖 [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) - Jay Alammar
  - Focus intensively on the Attention section
- 📖 [Attention? Attention!](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-06-24-attention/) - Lilian Weng
  - Deep dive into attention formulas and intuitive explanations

**Afternoon: Implementation**

- 💻 [Attention is All You Need - Annotated](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/)
  - Line-by-line explanation of the original paper implementation
- 🛠️ Implement single attention mechanism from scratch using NumPy (1 hour)

### Day 2: Karpathy's Intensive Course (6-8 hours)

**Required Viewing & Practice:**

- 🎥 [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) (2 hours)
- 💻 [nanoGPT repository](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT)
  - Focus on understanding `model.py` file (124 lines) completely

**Parallel Work:**

- Code along with the video
- Print tensor shapes at each component to understand dimensions
- Experiment with different parameters

### Day 3: Minimal Implementation (6-8 hours)

**Morning: Core Components**

Implement the following essential components:

```python
# Core components to implement
- MultiHeadAttention
- FeedForward
- LayerNorm
- PositionalEncoding
- TransformerBlock
```

**Reference Materials:**

- 💻 [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) - Cleaner implementation
- 📖 [The Annotated GPT-2](https://amaarora.github.io/posts/2020-02-18-annotatedGPT2.html)

**Afternoon: Training**

- Train on tiny shakespeare dataset
- Verify that loss decreases during training
- Generate sample text outputs

### Day 4-5: (Optional) Deep Dive

**Optimization and Advanced Understanding:**

- 📖 [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) - Original paper (much easier to understand after implementation)
- 📖 [GPT-1 Paper](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf) - Understanding decoder-only architecture
- 💻 [Transformer from Scratch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transformer_tutorial.html) - PyTorch official tutorial

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
python >= 3.8
numpy
torch
transformers (optional, for comparison)
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/study_transformer.git
cd study_transformer

# Install dependencies
pip install numpy torch matplotlib
```

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this study program, you will:

- ✅ Understand the mathematical foundations of attention mechanism
- ✅ Know how multi-head attention works intuitively and mathematically
- ✅ Implement a working transformer model from scratch
- ✅ Train a small language model and see it generate text
- ✅ Understand the difference between encoder-decoder and decoder-only architectures
- ✅ Be able to read and understand transformer-related research papers

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Self-Attention Mechanism**
   - Query, Key, Value matrices
   - Scaled dot-product attention
   - Attention scores and softmax

2. **Multi-Head Attention**
   - Parallel attention heads
   - Concatenation and projection
   - Why multiple heads help

3. **Position Encoding**
   - Sinusoidal encoding
   - Learned position embeddings
   - Relative vs absolute position

4. **Transformer Architecture**
   - Layer normalization
   - Residual connections
   - Feed-forward networks
   - Decoder-only vs encoder-decoder

## Tips for Success

- 🎯 Don't rush through Day 1 - solid understanding of attention is crucial
- 🖊️ Write code, don't just read it - implement everything yourself
- 🐛 Debug by printing tensor shapes constantly
- 📊 Visualize attention weights to build intuition
- 💬 Join communities (r/MachineLearning, Twitter ML community) to ask questions
- 🔄 Iterate - reimplement components if you don't understand them fully

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Skipping the math - understand the formulas before coding
- ❌ Copy-pasting code without understanding
- ❌ Not testing components individually
- ❌ Training on too large dataset initially
- ❌ Getting lost in implementation details before understanding the big picture
